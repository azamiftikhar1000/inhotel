The Chedi is the first of its kind in Europe, offering premium luxury residences designed by world renown architects and designers in the superbly situated Andermatt Swiss Alps.
Managed by international hotel operator GHM General Hotel Management Ltd, Singapore, the hotel operates as part of an existing hotel chain trading under the name "THE CHEDI". The Chedi Andermatt, designed by notable international architects Denniston International and has been modelled on traditional alpine chalet architecture, with gabled roofs and wooden panelling. With its many layers and decorative designs The Chedi Andermatt is an aesthetic focal point to Andermatt village.
The Penthouses in The Chedi Andermatt combine the exclusivity of a private home with the facilities of one of the most elegant and luxurious hotels in the Alps.
Penthouse owners have full access to the renowned ‘Chedi Experience’ which includes impeccable 24-hour concierge service, a cigar and wine lounge, bar areas and an après-ski bar with an outside terrace and the finest dining and ultramodern fitness and wellness facilities, which combines heated indoor swimming pools, treatments rooms and areas to relax and unwind. With high-quality construction, exquisite design and a strong focus on comfort and privacy, the Penthouses will meet all expectation. 
The Penthouses are sold ‘shell and core’, so within the spacious properties – ranging from around 189 to 616 sqm – owers are free to shape the space to suit their preferences and lifestyle requirements. Whether choosing the suggested interior finishing scheme in the style of the hotel or adopting a personalised Penthouse design, owners can give their imagination free reign.

Each Penthouse is destined to become a unique dream come true in the Swiss Alps.
True to the philosophy of sustainability, the Chedi Andermatt, which opened in December 2013, complies with the MINERGIE-Standard and buildings are made with materials native to the region. The Chedi Andermatt will set new standards in the Alps.
The existing, picturesque village of Andermatt is being transformed with the population capacity set to almost double. The area is undergoing a huge redevelopment and what was once a somewhat overlooked resort is having its pisted area and amenities extended significantly to make it one of the largest winter sports destinations in Switzerland. Andermatt already has access to around 125 km of piste between 1,444-2,963 metres.
Andermatt is a pretty village with a good snow record and impressive skiing and boarding on the Gemsstock, including some fabulous off-piste runs. Near the station are the sunny slopes of the Natschen which hosts a range of winter activities and provide good facilities for learners and intermediates.
Andermatt is remarkably accessible. Thanks to its central location and its vicinity to the major transit routes (North-South and East-West), Andermatt has excellent connections to the transport network.
Andermatt is easily accessible by road and rail with connection times of around 1.5 hours from Zurich and 2 hours from Milan. 
Facilities:
The Chedi Andermatt offers outstanding personalised facilities and services for the discerning guests and residence owners. The hotel is featuring three main dining facilities: The signature outlet, The Restaurant, showcases four open kitchens specializing in cold cuts, desserts, Western and Asian cuisine. Here the chefs are visible to guests while they work on their creations.
One of the only resorts in the Swiss Alps to serve Japanese cuisine, The Japanese Restaurant serves authentic Japanese delicacies prepared at its teppanyaki bar or its tempura & sushi bar. A selection of special Japanese sake and beer are available.
The Wine & Cigar Library invites guests to enjoy views of The Courtyard in this walk-in humidor, which also offers some of the finest wines by the glass. In the winter months, a cosy fire is lit, creating the perfect alpine setting. 
The Lobby is the place to see and be seen, surrounded by The Bar, The Spa and The Pool Area. There are two fireplaces creating a warm atmosphere in this central space. A light menu of small dishes can be served here, in addition to the hotel’s variant of Afternoon Tea – The Chedi Afternoon Tea.
After a full day on the slopes or the golf course guests can meet and relax at The Bar and Living Room. Here the Ski Butler’s can make guests’ arrangements for the next day on the slopes, and tee-offs can be organised for golfers. Small dishes of local snacks are served here, alongside a selection of wine and beer. 
Offering guests a breath-taking view of the Gemsstock, The Courtyard is the perfect place to unwind anytime, winter or summer. It features a terrace and large pond as well as an ice rink in the winter. A small bar serves refreshing drinks in warm weather and mulled wine in the chilly months.
The Pool Area offers guests not only a 35-metre indoor pool, but also an outdoor swimming pool, complete with bath.

Regional Info



Andermatt. A Home in Uri Canton. In a wide, high valley close to the source of both the Rhine and Rhone rivers and below the vital Gotthard Pass, Andermatt lies at the very centre of Switzerland. Its strategic history includes time as an important trading town and a buzzy staging post for Alpine travellers. German poet Goethe described Andermatt in 1770 as “the most interesting and beautiful place” and that description certainly holds true today. After many years of operating below most skiers’ radar, Andermatt recently unveiled one of the most exciting and ambitious projects in the Alps. New hotels, modern chalet-style apartment buildings and extensive facilities from a Kurt Rossknecht-designed golf course to an indoor sports centre are making Andermatt the place to watch. The golf course and several new properties are complete. The first new hotel, the wonderfully opulent yet always intimate five-star Chedi Hotel opened in 2013 and immediately secured a place on Conde Nast Traveller’s Best Hotels List. Apartments and penthouses in The Chedi and other new-build homes in the resort have brought a new fan base to this long-established town. Andermatt Overview: Best for: Serious off-piste skiers, golfers and active families looking for a comfortable, year-round Swiss home free of all restrictions on foreign ownership. Property: Contemporary and fully serviced apartments and penthouses at various price points in a charmingly authentic and historic Swiss town. Who Owns There: Buyers from across Europe and the Middle East come for the Swiss quality of life, the world-class Chedi Hotel, bracing off-piste skiing, a PGA golf course and the potential of a year-round resort that is undergoing significant and exciting development. Access: Andermatt is well connected by road and rail, around 90 minutes from Zurich airport and within two hours of Milan.

Financing
Arrangements have been made with leading Swiss banks to provide financing to qualified buyers at attractive interest rates. The typical loan to value (LTV) rate is 50-60% of the purchase price, although the actual LTV is determined at the bank’s discretion.

Taxation
Owners of a residence at The Chedi Andematt are liable to pay income tax on the net rental income of the unit. If a residence is not earmarked for participation in the rental programme with the hotel, the basis for evaluating income tax is the so-called notional rental value (estimated at approx. 2.5% of the purchase price). If a residence is participating in the rental programme, the rental income as well as the value of the owner’s personal usage forms the basis for the income tax calculation. The income tax rate, depending on the individual tax situation of the buyer, is approximately 27%. An annual property tax of approximately 0.2% is levied in Andermatt on the value of a residence less liabilities. In addition, an annual charge for second homes of CHF 14 per square metre net-living space will be levied annually, unless the buyer rents out the unit on a permanent basis to The Chedi Andermatt hotel and uses the unit only for a short-term. The capital gain (difference between sales price and purchase price) will be subject to Swiss real estate capital gains tax of approximately 11% to 31% depending on the capital gains amount and the respective holding period.
Acquisition costs
The acquisition of a residence in The Chedi Andermatt is subject to a land registration duty of 0.2% on the purchase price, up to a maximum of CHF 10,000. Notary fees will amount to a maximum of 0.2% on the transaction price, with CHF 2,000 as a minimum.
Annual running costs
Owners will be responsible for a resort maintenance fee of approximately CHF 130 per square metre and utility charges of approximately CHF 37 per square metre (water, electricity, heating, telephone, TV, internet). The resort maintenance fee shall cover the charges, fees, cost and expenses payable for the maintenance, management, security, insurance, upkeep, renewal, repair and replacement of the common areas comprising also the common utility charges. Furthermore, owners are granted access to all the hotel’s public areas that are also accessible to hotel guests. Individual consumption of food and beverages, goods or services is not covered by the communal charge for costs.
Rental Programme
The buyer will be able to participate in the rental programme proposed by The Chedi Andermatt hotel. The unit owner will receive 50% of the actual net rental proceeds of his/her unit minus an administration fee of 12% and a marketing and reservation fee of 4%. Participation in the rental programme is not mandatory.

The reservation fee will be refundable within 8 weeks from signing the reservation form, minus a handling fee.
Payment terms
50% of the purchase price minus the reservation fee (first purchase price instalment) is due on registration of the Sale and Purchase Agreement. No interest is payable for this instalment. 50% of the purchase price (second purchase price instalment) is due at the time of the transfer of title.
