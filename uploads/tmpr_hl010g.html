Very beautiful hotel and staff was helpful and friendly. The room was spacious and beautifully deocrated





Yunting

Switzerland






Probably the best room I've ever stayed in. Beautifully designed, ample space, and nicely laid out.Spa is great, Hamam placement should have been placed better, but still very nice.





Ioannis

Switzerland






I can honestly say that I liked absolutely everything about my stay here. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with warm and friendly hospitality, setting the tone for a memorable experience. The room was simply outstanding. Spacious, elegantly decorated, and the attention to detail. The spa at this hotel is a true oasis of relaxation. The restaurant was another highlight of my stay. The culinary offerings were nothing short of spectacular. The waitstaff were attentive, and the ambiance was delightful.
In summary, this hotel exceeded all my expectations. If you're looking for a place that combines luxurious accommodations, a serene spa, and a top-notch restaurant, look no further. I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone seeking an exceptional and unforgettable stay.

Room was Beautiful and the breakfast was very good





Matthew

The room was a good size, very conformable, all amenities worked well and was relaxing.  The quality of the toiletries was good, the shower was excellent. The breakfast had plenty of choice, although the room itself might be crowded in peak periods. The spa was well equipped, good service and clean. the staff were very helpful and friendly and went out of their way to make the stay comfortable, especially the concierge service was excellent and really helped us in securing medication that we needed from a pharmacy 30 mins away.
